Algebra is so much like arithmetic that all that you know about addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, and division, the signs that you have been using\nand the ways of working out problems, will be very useful to you in this study.\nThere are two things the introduction of which really makes all the difference\nbetween arithmetic and algebra. One of these is the use of letters to represent\nnumbers, and you will see in the following exercises that this change makes the\nsolution of problems much easier.\nExercise I.\nIllustrative Example.

How far is he from where he started?\nWe find a difficulty in solving this last example, because we do not know\njust how large x, b, m, y, and z are with reference to each other. This is only one\nexample of a large class of problems which may arise, in which we find direction\neast and west, north and south; space before and behind, to the right and to the\nleft, above and below; time past and future; money gained and lost; everywhere\nthese opposite relations. This relation of oppositeness must be expressed in\nsome way in our representation of numbers.\nIn algebra, therefore, numbers are considered as increasing from zero in\nopposite directions. Those in one direction are called Positive Numbers (or +\nnumbers); those in the other direction Negative Numbers (or - numbers).\nIn Illus. 4, if we call direction east positive, then direction west will be nega-\ntive, and the respective distances that the man traveled will be +x, -b, +m, +y,\nand -z. Combining these, the answer to the problem becomes x - b + m + y - z.\nIf the same analysis be applied to Illus. 3, we get 15 - 30 + 20 + 5 - 6 = +4, or\n4 miles north of starting-point.\nThe minus sign before a single number makes the number neg-\native, and shows that the number has a subtractive relation to any\nother to which it may be united, and that it will diminish that number\nby its value. It shows a relation rather than an operation.\nNegative numbers are the second of the two things referred to on page 7, the\nintroduction of which makes all the difference between arithmetic and algebra.\nNOTE.--Negative numbers are usually spoken of as less than zero, because\nthey are used to represent losses. To illustrate: suppose a man's money affairs\nbe such that his debts just equal his assets, we say that he is worth nothing.\nSuppose now that the sum of his debts is $1000 greater than his total assets.\nHe is worse off than by the first supposition, and we say that he is worth less\nthan nothing. We should represent his property by -1000 (dollars).\nExercise 11.\n1. Express the difference between a and b.\n23\n2. By how much is b greater than 10?\n3.
